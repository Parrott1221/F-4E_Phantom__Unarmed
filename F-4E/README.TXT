F-4E

REFUELING:

Click on the REFUEL switch, ARM position to arm the refueling system and open the refueling door.  
Click on the REFUEL switch again, OFF position to disarm the refueling system and retract the probe.  
Fuel onload is at 6000 pounds per minute.

FUEL DUMP:

Click on the DUMP switch to toggle the fuel dump system.  Dump rate is 2500 lbs/min.  The system will 
not dump lower than a standpipe level of 4000 pounds.

RADAR:

The radar has 40 and 20 nm range modes.  Yellow targets are AI, green targets are MP.

TAIL HOOK:

The tail hook has no weight/speed limits.

DRAG CHUTE:

The drag chute has a 210 kt speed limit.


THE MODEL:

The model was originally made by Alpha Simulations (http://www.alphasim.co.uk/) and was done in Microsoft's
native format (MDL) for use with MSFS.  It was released by them as "freeware, non-commercial", so don't
sell this model.  I converted it to AC3D format for use in FlightGear.  I added a 3D cockpit, spoilers
for roll control (the F-4 used a combination of ailerons and spoilers), animated slats, and fixed AIM-7
Sparrows, refueling door, lights, tanks, bombs, AIM-9's.


THE AI MODEL: 

Since the model is so texture heavy I've included a very low-poly (and untextured) model in the /Models/AI directory.
